Act as an expert web developer.
Create a stopwatch webpage with plain html, css and javascript.
It should follow the next requirements:
- The design should be exactly like the one in the attached stopwatch.png.
- Center it in the middle of the screen and make it responsive for different screen sizes
- The format of the time is HH:MM:SS and the small "000" are the miliseconds
- The start button will initiate the stopwatch or resume it if it was stopped. It will change to "Stop" when the stopwatch is running and to "Resume" when it is stopped but not on 00:00:00.
