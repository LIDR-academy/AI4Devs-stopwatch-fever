As a web developer, applying best practices for html and css, reproduce this design https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omar-fever/AI4Devs-stopwatch-fever/refs/heads/main/res/stopwatch.png using the files in this folder from https://github.com/omar-fever/AI4Devs-stopwatch-fever/tree/main/template

These are the requirements of the design:
1. the "start" button should start the stopwatch and change its text to "pause"
2. the "pause" button should pause the stopwatch and change its text to "continue"
3. the "clear" button should clear the stopwatch, and it should be disabled if the stopwatch is already cleared
4. all the html elements should be center aligned, horizontally and vertically

At the end of the task, add the description of the pull request for this change in Markdown format

-------

Update the previous solution to match the designs in the image:

1. Stopwatch:
   * showing hours, minutes and seconds.
   * also, the milliseconds using a 3 digits number under the seconds
2. Buttons:
   * They should match the designs in the image

The script now should also handle the milliseconds

-------

The styling does not match the given image. Modify the css to match it exactly. 

-------

The styles do not match the image in background, border, font-size, milliseconds alignment, uppercase and lowercase texts, color of the buttons.
Please analyze the image and make it pixel perfect
