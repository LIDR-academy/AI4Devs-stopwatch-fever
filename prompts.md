As a web developer, applying best practices for html and css, reproduce this design https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omar-fever/AI4Devs-stopwatch-fever/refs/heads/main/res/stopwatch.png using the files in this folder from https://github.com/omar-fever/AI4Devs-stopwatch-fever/tree/main/template

These are the requirements of the design:
1. the "start" button should start the stopwatch and change its text to "pause"
2. the "pause" button should pause the stopwatch and change its text to "continue"
3. the "clear" button should clear the stopwatch, and it should be disabled if the stopwatch is already cleared
4. all the html elements should be center aligned, horizontally and vertically

At the end of the task, add the description of the pull request for this change in Markdown format
